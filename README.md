# Acknowledgement 

These shaders would not have been possible without the pioneering work of Artyom Zuev, who has [graciously shared](https://bitbucket.org/bac9/shading/overview) his own decal shaders,
as well as [documented his process](https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/how-do-i-write-a-normal-decal-shader-using-a-newly-added-unity-5-2-finalgbuffer-modifier.356644/) of creating them.
